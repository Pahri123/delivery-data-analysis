# Delivery Data Analysis
This repository contains the analysis of delivery data for a company's branch in one Region over a one-month period. The analysis was performed using Google Spreadsheet. The dataset consists of three files:

- (sample) Delivery_data.xlsx: This file contains the raw data used for the analysis. It provides information about customer data, delivery data, and driver performance data.

- Delivery_data.xlsx: This file contains the process of analyzing the delivery data. It includes various calculations, visualizations, and insights derived from the dataset.

- Delivery Data Analysis.pptx: This file presents a summary of the analysis of the delivery data. It provides an overview of the key aspects, such as delivery status, cost, driver performance, and delivery time. The objective of this analysis is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the delivery operations and identify opportunities for informed decision-making and process optimization.

Future improvements for this analysis could include further exploring customer data, conducting additional analyses, and incorporating other relevant factors to enhance the insights and recommendations.
